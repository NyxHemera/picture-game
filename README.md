#The Picture Game
---
The Picture Game was a project I made using the Ruby on Rails framework. It is a web version of a game I played in college, where a group of people would sit in a circle, they would all write a short story on the top of a page of paper, and then they would pass the paper to their right. The next person would draw a picture of that story, then fold the paper and pass it to their right. This would go on until the drawing gets all the way around the circle.

I built CanvasActual, a drawing application built from scratch in JavaScript using the HTML5 Canvas Element. I had a few goals with this project:

- Create my own drawing application allowing users to draw lines and shapes using either the mouse or a touchscreen
- Build my first Full-Stack application using Rails
- Implement a custom CSS framework I'm developing called Apheleia

The current full application can be viewed [here](http://the-picture-game.herokuapp.com/)

###Issues
---
- Some issues implementing mobile responsiveness for CanvasActual. If you zoom in on the canvas, you cannot zoom out easily.
- The toolbar in CanvasActual occasionally acts crazy and flys off the screen.

###Future Features
---
- Ability to Share and Download drawings and games
- Better tools in CanvasActual
- Implementing a front-end framework such as Angular to allow for a single page site experience
